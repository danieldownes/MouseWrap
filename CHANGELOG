# Version History

## Version 2.04:

Released: 12/01/2005

Modification Details:

Customers of Mouse Wrap were experiencing problems while dragging or resizing windows from one side of the screen to the other using the wrapping functionality. This is because Microsoft Windows will restrict the mouse pointer to only the work-area of the desktop while dragging of normal windows (i.e. it is not possible to drag windows over the taskbar in its default ‘keep on top’ setting enabled).

Mouse Wrap 2.04 solves this problem by detecting when the user is trying to drag or resize a window beyond the taskbar, while still using the minimum amount of your computer’s resources. 

Note, there is a very slight delay when wrapping from the edge of the taskbar, this is because it takes time to evaluate if it is necessary to do the wrap while using low resources.

Mouse Wrap will respect the size and position of your taskbar.
