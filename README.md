Mouse Wrap is a small utility to enhance the mobility of the Windows mouse pointer. It does this by wrapping the movement of the mouse pointer around the edges of the screen. When the pointer touches an edge of the screen it will instantly appear on the opposite side of the screen as shown on the animation.

This edgeless experience in a desktop environment allows for faster interaction, especially when larger screen resolutions are involved.

The project has been running for 25 years! I love coffee, pledge support via [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/danieldownes/mouse-wrap-4) and your contribution will be very much appreciated.
